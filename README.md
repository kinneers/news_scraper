# news_scraper
A web app utilizing Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news which allows users to view and leave comments on the latest news

Note: I originally attempted to scrape BuzzFeed and was successful... until I discovered that BuzzFeed is changing their HTML tags daily and I would have to update constantly to keep the app working. Since this app is for educational purposes, I chose to switch to a site less likely to change tags (and break my scraping app).  The downfall is that this site does not have a summary of each article.

Note: This app was designed for educational purposes and is for personal use only.  Please scrape responsibly!

Note: Mongoose currently does not support sorting after populate.
